## Extensions
### WeatherWalls
WeatherWalls is a shortcut created by u/apoch8000 that allows you to set the weather as your wallpaper. I have recreated it to allow for native support with my shortcut, all you have to do is enable it in settings and it will set the weather as the lock screen and your SnoWall ‚ùÑÔ∏è as the homescreen. All images are property of their creators.
### SunMoonWeather
SunMoonWeather is a shortcut created by @thewaytozion sets your wallpaper as an informative UI with weather details and sunrise/sunset effect. I have adapted it to run natively with SnoWalls ‚ùÑÔ∏è. By default, it will overlay the temperature and city on the lock screen. You can configure the settings within the shortcut section for SunMoonWeather.
### Maui Snorkel Report ü§ø
This extension was created by me and overlays the snorkeling conditions in Maui, HI on your lock screen. It only runs if you are in Maui and if the time is between 6 am and 12 pm.
### Custom Extension
With a custom extension enabled, you will be propmted to input the name of the shortcut you are running as an extension. It will run after all other extensions. When creating this shortcut, create an action where it accepts an image as shortcut image. From here, you can overlay text or images onto it, or customize your wallpaper further in anyway you want. Just make sure to end the shortcut with the action "Exit Shortcut with [the final wallpaper image].
